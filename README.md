## Introduction

**dyPixa** is a project that enables you to analyze _Multilingual_ text, perform _sentiment analysis,_ and use the emotions expressed in the text to generate abstract images with carefully selected color combinations. It would leverage state-of-the-art _machine learning_ models and _image processing_ techniques to achieve this. Additionally, _dyPixa_ allows you to overlay the input text onto the generated abstract image, creating visually striking compositions.  

## Features

> * **Multilingual Text and Sentiment Analysis:** dyPixa can analyze Hindi text and determine its sentiment, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.  
>  
> * **Color Combination Model:** Train a machine learning model using a dataset of images paired with text descriptions to learn the most suitable color combinations for different sentiments.  
>  
> * **Abstract Image Generation:** Generate abstract images based on the input text's sentiment, utilizing the color combinations learned by the model.  
>  
> * **Text Overlay:** Overlay the input text onto the generated abstract image, allowing you to create visually appealing compositions that convey the text's emotion.  

## Getting Started

To get started with _dyPixa,_ follow these steps:  

1. [Fork](https://github.com/thedatatribune/dyPixa/fork) this repository and clone using following command:  
> 
> ```sh
> $ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dyPixa.git  
> $ cd dyPixa  
> ```  

2. Install Dependencies:  
> - Install the required Python libraries by running _(the `requirements.txt` is updated with growth of the project)_:  
>   ```sh
>   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
>   ```  
> - Download Pre-trained Models _(applicable in future as the project grows):_  
> Depending on the project's requirements, you might need to download pre-trained models for sentiment analysis or color combination generation. Check the project documentation for instructions on acquiring these models.  

3. Run/Enhance the Project:  
> - Follow the project-specific instructions in the documentation _(to be updated)_ to use _dyPixa_ for text analysis, color combination generation, abstract image creation, and text overlay. Once you are inthe working directory, i.e., `dyPixa`; you can also start enhancing the code. Being open-source, maintainers would love to merge your contributions.  

## Usage

Being in an early phase of the development, the usage guide for _dyPixa_ is yet to be populated. However, with this tool, one would be able to do:  

1. Text Analysis and Sentiment Analysis  
<!-- - Use the provided functions to analyze Hindi text and determine its sentiment. -->

2. Color Combination Generation  
<!-- - Train or use pre-trained models to generate color combinations based on sentiment. -->

3. Abstract Image Generation  
<!-- - Utilize the color combinations to create abstract images representing the input text's emotion. -->

4. Text Overlay  
<!-- - Overlay the input text onto the generated abstract image using provided functions. -->

<!-- For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the project documentation. -->

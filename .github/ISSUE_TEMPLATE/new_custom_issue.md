### **Describe the issue:**  
Provide a clear and concise overview of the problem or proposal.  

_For instance,_ the current workflow presents challenges as text overlaying on an abstract image relies on image generation, creating a sequential bottleneck.  
Exploring a modular approach to address this issue is imperative. 🧩

### **Describe the solution you'd like** 🛠️
Propose a solution or improvement. Suggest the creation of two distinct APIs:
1. An API for extracting sentiment from input text. 📝
2. An API for overlaying text onto a given image. 🖼️

### **Additional context** ℹ️
Include any relevant context, such as screenshots or proof of concept (PoC), to enhance understanding and support your suggestion.

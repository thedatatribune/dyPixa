# Models

This directory houses a diverse collection of both pretrained and newly generated ML and NLP models that are intended for integration on the backend.

Our primary goal is to optimize _dyPixa_ for the community. Therefore, our aim is to rigorously test as many pretrained models and self-created models (based on the provided data in the [`dataset`](../dataset/) directory) as possible. However, we strongly encourage contributors to primarily focus on developing new ML solutions that align with the project's requirements.

## Accepted Contributions

Within this directory, we welcome three types of contributions:

1. **Links to Online Existing Models:** You can provide links to existing online models in [OnlineModels.md](./OnlineModels.md).
2. **Self-Generated ML/NLP Models:** If you've developed your own ML/NLP models, please place the model files in suitable sub-directories within [`./models/`](./models/). Additionally, provide a brief usage instruction in [`README.md`](./models/README.md).
3. **Code:** We highly appreciate complete code implementations for building ML models and/or utilizing them. You can add such code contributions in [`./code/`](./code/).

**NOTE:** Please note that only models that align with the project's requirements will be accepted in [OnlineModels.md](./OnlineModels.md).
